Queue and Appointment Management Application

Our application will register and check in patients in the healthcare system. It will also allow patients to book an appointment with Doctors. After booking, patients will be given an ID. Then, a notification will be sent to the patients, telling them about their confirmation statuses. Lastly, the application will ask user which method to use for their payment: card, insurance, or cash.
