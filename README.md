Queue and Appointment Management Application

Our application will register and check in patients in the healthcare system. It will also allow patients to book an appointment with General Doctors. After booking, patients will be placed in a virtual queue. Then, a notification will be sent to the patients, telling them about their queue and confirmation statuses. After that, it will track the queue and allocate resources accordingly. Lastly, the application will ask user which method to use for their payment: card, insurance, or cash.
